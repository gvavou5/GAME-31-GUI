# GAME-31-GUI
Game Development - Game 31 with Graphical Interface 

# How it works?
This is a heads up implementation of Game 31 with outstanding graphical interface. 
Only two (2) players are able to play its time. 
The first player is always the PC, named Big-Blue. 
The other one is a player that is playing. 
First you have to press the button NEW GAME to start a new session. 
At this point we have to give a username. 
If the username is empty ('') or Player then automatically the player 
gets the name Uplayer and is not possible to get a place in the Hall of Fame. 
Then, Big-Blue is playing and gets cards. 
Remember that you do not know what strategy Big-Blue follows. 
Next, you have to click on the pack of cards until you are satisfied with the score that you have. 
The goal of the game is to reach the highest possible score which is 31. 
If someone of the players exceed 31 then is automatically lost.
If both players have score less or equal of 31 the winner is the player with the 
highest score. In case of equal score there is no winner in the specific round. 

# Implementation 
This version of Game 31 is implemented using Python.
